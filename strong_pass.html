            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">What Is a Strong Password?</h1>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Length Matters</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">A strong password should be at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are significantly
                harder
                for thieves to crack. Aim for a mix of characters that spans at least 12 to 16 characters. This makes
                your
                password more resilient against brute force attacks, where hackers try every possible combination to
                guess your
                password.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Mix It Up</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Incorporate a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special
                characters (e.g.,
                !, @, #, $, %) in your passwords. This complexity significantly reduces the chances of attackers
                guessing or
                using automated tools to brute-force your password. Each additional type of character adds another layer
                of
                complexity for hackers to overcome.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Avoid Common Words and Patterns</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Steer clear of using easily guessable passwords like "password", "12345678", or keyboard
                patterns
                such as "qwerty" or "asdfghjkl". Hackers often use lists of common passwords to attempt quick breaches.
                Additionally, avoid using personal information such as your name, birthday, or pet names, as these can
                often be
                easily found on social media.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Use Mnemonics or Passphrases</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Craft your passwords using memorable phrases, a string of unrelated words, or mnemonics that
                only
                make sense to you. For example, the first letters of each word in a sentence or a lyric from your
                favorite song,
                combined with numbers and symbols, can make for a strong but memorable password. The key is
                unpredictability and
                length, making it hard for others to guess but easy for you to remember.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Unique Passwords for Each Account</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Using the same password across multiple accounts dramatically increases your vulnerability.
                If one
                account is compromised, all other accounts sharing the same password are at risk. Ensure each account
                has a
                unique password, especially for your email, banking, and social media accounts. This way, if one
                password is
                exposed, it doesn't put your other accounts at risk.</p>

            <p class="mt-6">Creating and managing strong passwords for all your accounts can be daunting. Consider using
                a
                reputable password manager to generate, retrieve, and store complex passwords. This can simplify your
                online
                security while ensuring that each password is unique and strong. Remember, the strength of your password
                can
                significantly reduce the risk of your accounts being compromised. Regularly update your passwords,
                especially if
                you hear about a security breach involving one of your service providers.</p>

            <div class="mt-6">
                <!-- Bullet points -->
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Length and Complexity: Longer passwords with a mix of character types provide the best defense
                        against hacking attempts.
                        Each additional character exponentially increases the number of possible combinations.</li>
                    <li>Avoid Common Words: Using common words or phrases makes your password vulnerable to dictionary
                        attacks, where hackers
                        use software to quickly try a vast number of common words and phrases.</li>
                    <li>Personal Information: Personal info can often be guessed or found online, so it's best avoided
                        in passwords.</li>
                    <li>Unique Passwords: Unique passwords for each account help contain potential damage from data
                        breaches. It means that even
                        if one password is compromised, your other accounts remain secure.</li>
                    <li>Password Managers: Password managers not only store your passwords securely but also help
                        generate strong, random
                        passwords for each of your accounts, reducing the burden of having to remember each one.</li>
